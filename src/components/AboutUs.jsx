            Welcome to the Festival Committee of K-Ville Phase III and IV!
            We are a group of enthusiastic residents who come together to plan, organize, and celebrate festivals and cultural events in our society.

            Our mission is simple - to create moments of joy, togetherness, and cultural harmony for all age groups. From traditional celebrations and festive decorations to fun activities, competitions, and community gatherings, we aim to make every occasion special.

            The committee works with the spirit of unity, creativity, and volunteerism, ensuring that each event reflects our society's vibrant culture and diversity.
